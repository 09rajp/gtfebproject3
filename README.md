# Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp
## Project 3 Group List

Please pull this repository, update the list in `teams.txt` with your team information in the format provided, and push it back to this repository on *a separate branch*.  I will merge the file.

The structure is defined at the top of the file -- DO NOT REMOVE THIS!

## Instructions

*You can edit a text file directly on GitHub!*

But if you want to do it the developer way:

- Pull the repository
- Create a new branch on your machine - `git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`
- Edit and save the `teams.txt` file with your group's information using the template at the top.
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "My team's information"`
- `git push -u origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`

That's it.  You can open the pull request if you like, but I will do the merging.

Good luck!
